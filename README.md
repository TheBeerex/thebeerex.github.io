##### Hello there! I see you're taking a look at my website's README file! Look at you! I call myself a netrunner. I do a lot of different things on and off the net. To name a few, I program, play the vidya games, and run D&D campaigns as a Dungeon Master. I've also dabled a little in VRoid studio to make my avatar and VTubing model. I do the occasional live stream, but university makes that difficult, so its only during long breaks.
